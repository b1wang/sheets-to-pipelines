# Week 01 - Basic Infrastructure Setup

Date: March 17th, 2025

## Updates:
- Created GitHub project for the repo

## Agenda:

1. Implement ETL script to import new products from a given price list excel.
     - Expected columns: sku, description, msrp, t2_cost, item_cost
     - Changes in MSRP, t2_cost, and item_cost should be tracked historically (Look into SCD tables)
2. Create a basic Streamlit UI that allows user to drag & drop Excel files and CSVs. 
3. Start setting up FastAPI backend.
