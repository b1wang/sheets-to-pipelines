# Week 01 - Basic Infrastructure Setup

Date: March 17th, 2025

## Updates:
- Created GitHub project for the repo

## Agenda:

1. Implement ETL script to import new products from a given price list excel.
     - Expected columns: sku, description, msrp, t2_cost, item_cost
     - Changes in MSRP, t2_cost, and item_cost should be tracked historically (Look into SCD tables)
2. Create a basic Streamlit UI that allows user to drag & drop Excel files and CSVs. 
3. Start setting up FastAPI backend.

## Reflection:

Fleshing out the basic structures for these features was fun - although managing my GitHub workflow with the GitHub Projects kanban was an interesting experience. I also started off the project pushing all the features to main, which I realized was bad practice and changed to using branches for each issue instead.

When creating the FastAPI connection with the postgres database, I also decided I wanted to use SQLAlchemy's ORM model to gain experience working with an ORM. For complex queries I can still use SQLAlchemy's Core model to pass in SQL queries. 

I implemented the products table as an SCD Type 2 table for tracking historical price / cost updates.
