# Week 01 - Kickoff

Date: March 14th, 2025

## Purpose of Project

This project marks the start of my endeavor to convert an almost entirely Excel-based data ecosystem into a structured data system with automated pipelines and ML / AI deployments. The goal is to leverage this project as a practical learning environment using company data and gaining experience deploying ML models following an industry-standard approach. 

## Initial Setup
1. Repository creation
    - Created sheets-to-pipelines repository.
    - Added an initial README.md and LICENSE (CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license).
2. Basic project structure and Docker setup
    - Created initial root project structure and documentation folders.
    - Created Docker containers for PostgreSQL, Juptyter Notebook, Airflow, and custom Python env for running scripts.
    - Mounted persistent storage using Docker volumes.
    - Set .env variables
3. Begin configuring Postgres database
    - Created products table and inserted current active skus.

## Next Steps

- Design and create sales fact table and build modular ETL processes to import records from multiple Excel files.
- Select business processes to automate (price web scraping, sales reports, )
