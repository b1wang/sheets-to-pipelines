# Week 02 - Finishing CRUD

Date: March 23rd, 2025

## Updates:
- Setup product POST/GET routes in FastAPI using SQLAlchemy's ORM model. 
- Designed the [entity relationship diagram](https://github.com/b1wang/sheets-to-pipelines/blob/main/docs/architecture/database_schema.excalidraw.png) to be used in PostgreSQL.
- Removed AirFlow from docker-compose, to be added at a later date.
- Created .dockerignore for faster image generation.
- Added to the README.

## Agenda:

1. Finish setting up PUT / DELETE routes for "products" table, and extend to other models.
2. Extend the models to include sales, inventory, and web metrics.
3. Write an ETL process to convert price lists into "product" updates. 
4. Continue with the frontend branch.
