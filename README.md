# <p style="text-align: center;"> From Excel Sheets to a Data Machine



*There are many companies that depend on Excel for their data management.*

Sheets-to-Pipeline is my journey of transforming a legacy, spreadsheet-based system into a robust data infrastructure—complete with automated ETL pipelines, a queryable database, business intelligence dashboards, and ML-ready architecture.

Built in a real-world business environment, this initiative demonstrates hands-on experience with:

- **Data engineering** (ETL pipelines, PostgreSQL, Airflow)
- **Backend development** (FastAPI, Docker, Pydantic)
- **Business intelligence** (clean dashboards, real metrics with Streamlit)
- **MLOps foundations** (structured data flow ready for ML models)

**The goal**: bring industry-standard practices into a non-technical setting—while gaining and showcasing skills relevant for data and ML engineering roles.
